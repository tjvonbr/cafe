# Lab 

This is an evolving project as I work through an old CS textbook, Software Engineering for Internet Applications, written by Eve Andersson, Philip Greenspun, and Andrew Grumet.  I was looking through some of the open-sourced MIT CS classes and noticed a class by the same title.  I read over the syllabus and noticed the book was free online and wanted to follow along with the chapter exercises.  By the end, the student will have created a fully functioning 'internet application' and addresses everything you'd expect when building a web app.
